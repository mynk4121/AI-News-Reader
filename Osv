**OS Virtualization in Cloud Computing**

- **What it is**: OS Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server by creating virtual instances (VMs).
  
- **How it works**: A hypervisor manages the virtual machines (VMs), each running its own OS and applications, while sharing the same physical hardware resources.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficient Resource Use**: Maximize hardware usage.
  - **Cost-Effective**: Fewer physical servers needed.
  - **Isolation**: Each VM is isolated, preventing one from affecting others.
  - **Flexibility**: Run different OS types on the same hardware.

- **Example**: AWS EC2 instances running different OS types (Windows, Linux) on the same physical server.

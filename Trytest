Overall, this year has been a period of significant growth and learning for me. I have successfully contributed to key projects in both the Authorization and Onboarding Teams, enhancing system efficiency and customer experience. Iâ€™ve also developed a deeper understanding of journey management, onboarding architecture, and risk management processes.

Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my skill set further by focusing on cloud technologies and gaining deeper expertise in REST API development. These areas are crucial for both my personal development and the evolving needs of the business. I am excited to continue contributing to Barclays' success while further advancing my technical skills.

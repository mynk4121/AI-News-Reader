### **Description of `putContactlessLimitFlag` Method**

This method manages the state of the **Contactless Limit** feature flag. It checks whether the feature is available and whether the customer meets the required conditions for enabling the feature. If the conditions are met, the feature is enabled; otherwise, it is turned off.

### **Constants Used:**
- `FeatureToFunction.CONTACTLESS_LIMIT` – Represents the Contactless Limit feature flag.
- `OperationConstants.CONTACTLESS` – Represents the key used to store the feature availability status.
- `ConfigurationkeyConstants.BUSINESS_CUSTOMER` – Constant used to check if the customer is a business customer.

### **Functions Used:**
- `isFeatureAvailable(FeatureToFunction.CONTACTLESS_LIMIT, serviceRequest)`  
  - Checks if the Contactless Limit feature is available based on the service request.
  
- `featureSwitchService.isContactlessLimitEnabled()`  
  - Checks if the Contactless Limit feature is enabled in the feature switch service.
  
- `turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.CONTACTLESS_LIMIT)`  
  - Turns off the Contactless Limit feature if the customer does not meet the eligibility conditions.

- `serviceRequest.getCustomerContext().getRegisteredCustomerClass()`  
  - Retrieves the customer type to check if the customer is a business customer.
  
- `serviceRequest.getCustomerContext().isBusinessOnlyMembership()`  
  - Checks if the customer is a Business Only member.

### **Policy Used:**
- **Business Customer Policy**: If the customer is a business customer and is not eligible for the **BB/DCSC** debit card, the feature will be turned off, even if it is enabled for non-business customers.
  
- **Feature Availability Based on Customer Type**: If the customer is a business customer, the eligibility for the Contactless Limit feature will also depend on whether the debit card is eligible.

### **Custom Code:**
- **Business Customer Eligibility**: The eligibility check considers whether the customer is a business customer and whether they have the necessary debit card eligibility (controlled by `isBbDcscEligibleDebitCardon`). This ensures that business customers are only able to use the feature under certain conditions.

### **Method Explanation with Steps:**

1. **Check Feature Availability**:
   - The method first checks if the **Contactless Limit** feature is available for the service request. If the feature is not available, it logs that the feature is switched off.

2. **Check Customer Eligibility**:
   - If the feature is available, the method retrieves the customer's type (`customerType`) and checks if the customer is a business customer (`isBOMCustomer`).
   - If the customer is a business customer, it checks if the customer is eligible for the Contactless Limit feature based on their debit card status and business membership.

3. **Feature Activation/Deactivation**:
   - If the customer is not eligible for the feature, it turns the feature off by calling `turnoffFunction`.
   - If the customer is eligible, the feature is considered available and the flag `isFeatureAvailable` is set to `true`.

4. **Store the Feature Status**:
   - The final availability status of the feature (`isFeatureAvailable`) is stored in the session parameters.

### **Logging**:
- The method logs each significant step, including feature availability status, customer eligibility checks, and the final outcome (whether the feature is turned on or off).

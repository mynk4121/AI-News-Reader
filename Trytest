Customer Eligibility Capability - Simplified Overview
The Customer Eligibility Capability focuses on verifying whether an introducer (a customer helping a young person open an account) meets the required eligibility criteria to proceed with the youth account application process at Barclays. This capability ensures that the introducer fulfills specific business requirements before they can continue with the application journey.

Key Eligibility Checks
The eligibility checks performed by this capability for introducers include:

Age Check: The introducer must be over 18 years old.
Account Limit Check: The introducer should have no more than four active accounts or open applications for youth accounts.
UK Residency Check: The introducer must be a resident of the UK.
KYC (Know Your Customer) Check: The introducer's KYC status must meet Barclays’ standards.
Geo-location Check: The introducer’s current location is verified to ensure they are within the UK.
If all these checks are passed, the eligibility result is stored in the Introducer Data Store associated with the introducer’s ID. If any checks fail, an error message is sent back to the channel, and the application cannot proceed.

Process Flow Overview
Eligibility Check API:

This is a Process API that performs all the necessary checks to verify the introducer’s eligibility.
The API is called when the introducer uses the Barclays Mobile Banking (BMB) App to start the application for a Bplus or YPA account.
Source System API (ODS Endpoint):

The Process API communicates with the ODS (Operational Data Store) endpoint to gather required data on the introducer, such as their age, KYC status, residency, and geo-location.
After receiving the response from ODS, the API evaluates the eligibility criteria for the introducer.
Eligibility Check Results:

If all criteria are met, a "PASS" response is stored, and the introducer is allowed to continue with the application.
In case of any failure, a specific error message (like "Age check failed" or "KYC status insufficient") is sent back to the BMB App.
Technical Details of Eligibility Check API
Request: The API receives input parameters including customer ID, journey type (e.g., Bplus), and optional geo-location data.
Response: The API returns either a "PASS" or "FAIL" status with detailed information on which eligibility checks passed or failed.

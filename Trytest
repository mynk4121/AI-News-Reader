### **Half-Line Description:**  
The `execute` method performs address lookup and validation based on the channel and app function, checking for feature availability, user authentication, and error handling while ensuring proper service response.

### **Constants, Functions, Policies, and Sessions Used:**

- **Constants:**
  - `OperationConstants.ADDRESS_LOOKUP_UPDATE` → Defines the operation function for address lookup update.
  - `OperationConstants.BCA_TRILLIUM_ADDRESS_FEATURE_KEY` → The feature key for address lookup functionality.
  - `OperationConstants.BCA_TRILLIUM_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_POSTCODE` → Defines the parameter for postcode lookup.
  - `ErrorCodes.MSG_OP_FATAL` → Error code for fatal operations.
  - `ErrorCodes.ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TECHNICAL_FAILURE_ALE02` → Error code for technical failure during address lookup.
  - `ErrorCodes.HTTP_SERVER_FAILURE_STATUS` → HTTP status code for server failure.
  - `OperationConstants.ERR308` → Specific error code related to failed address lookup.
  - `OperationConstants.TECHNICAL_FAILURE` → Defines the technical failure message.

- **Functions:**
  - `FeatureFlagsServiceResponse.isFeatureAvailable()` → Checks if the feature is available for the requested operation.
  - `getMobileUserContext()` → Retrieves the user context for mobile requests.
  - `serviceResponse.getErrors()` → Retrieves any errors returned by the service.
  - `businessService.getAddressFromPostcode(postCode)` → Retrieves the address based on postcode from the service.
  - `setSuccessStatusCodes()` → Sets success status codes for the response.
  - `setFailureStatusCodes()` → Sets failure status codes for the response.
  - `setFatalRequestStatusCode()` → Sets status code for fatal request conditions.

- **Policies:**
  - **Feature Availability Policy** → Ensures the feature is enabled before continuing with address lookup.
  - **Authentication Policy** → Verifies the user authentication, especially for Touch ID users.
  - **Error Handling Policy** → Handles errors like empty postcode, technical failures, and feature unavailability.
  - **Channel Identification Policy** → Differentiates between BCA and BMB channels for the request.

- **Session:**
  - `getMobileUserContext(request)` → Retrieves the mobile user context from the session.
  - `request.getSession()` → Session management for handling user-specific data such as Touch ID status.

### **Small Descriptions for Each Method:**

1. **`getChannelId(OperationRequest opReq)`**
   - Determines the channel ID (BMB or BCA) based on the service code from the operation request.

2. **`FeatureFlagsServiceResponse.isFeatureAvailable()`**
   - Checks whether the address lookup update feature is available for the current function and user.

3. **`getMobileUserContext(request)`**
   - Retrieves the mobile user context to validate user authentication and session status.

4. **`businessService.getAddressFromPostcode(postCode)`**
   - Makes a service call to fetch the address details based on the provided postcode.

5. **`setSuccessStatusCodes(opResponse)`**
   - Sets the success status codes for the operation response upon successful address lookup.

6. **`setFailureStatusCodes(opResponse)`**
   - Sets failure status codes if an error occurs, such as invalid postcode or unavailable service.

7. **`setFatalRequestStatusCode(opResponse)`**
   - Handles the termination of the request with a fatal status if certain conditions (e.g., suspicious request) are met.

8. **`LOGGER.debug()` / `LOGGER.error()` / `LOGGER.trace()`**
   - Logs various debugging and error messages to track the progress and status of the request handling.

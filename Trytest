### **Logic**
1. **Retrieve Customer Group List**:  
   Fetches the list of customer groups from the session parameters.

2. **Construct Analytics Tag**:  
   Iterates through the customer group list and appends relevant tags based on the group type. It handles various customer groups such as "Under 16," "Rasputin Group," "Wealth Private Bank," "Premier," and more.

3. **Check for Personal Membership**:  
   If the customer is personal, it appends the "PERSONAL_CUSTOMER" tag.

4. **Remove Extra Underscore**:  
   If the tag ends with an underscore, it removes it.

5. **Set the Tag in Response**:  
   Sets the final constructed segment level analytics tag in the service response.

### **Logging**
1. **LOGGER.debug**:  
   Logs the customer group list and the final segment level analytics tag for debugging.

This method ensures that a segment analytics tag is dynamically created based on the customer's group types, and this tag is then used to categorize the customer in various segments for analytics purposes.

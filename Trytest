### **Description:**  
This method checks if the **Delete Registration** feature is enabled and whether the customer qualifies based on a throttling range. If the feature is unavailable or the customer does not meet the criteria, the function disables the **Delete Registration** feature.  

### **Constants Used:**  
- **`FeatureToFunction.DELETEREG`** – Represents the Delete Registration feature.  
- **`ConfigurationKeyConstants.DELETEREG_THROTTLE_MIN`** – Minimum threshold for throttling.  
- **`ConfigurationKeyConstants.DELETEREG_THROTTLE_MAX`** – Maximum threshold for throttling.  
- **`OperationConstants.DEFAULT_THROTTLE_MIN`** – Default minimum throttle value.  
- **`OperationConstants.DEFAULT_THROTTLE_MAX`** – Default maximum throttle value.  

### **Functions Used:**  
1. **`isFeatureAvailable(FeatureToFunction.DELETEREG, serviceRequest)`** – Checks if the Delete Registration feature is available.  
2. **`throttlingService.isCustomerAllowedToContinueWithoutThrottling(customerId, min, max)`** – Determines if the customer falls within the allowed throttling range.  
3. **`turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.DELETEREG)`** – Disables the feature if the customer does not qualify.  

### **Custom Code:**  
- **Throttling Check for Delete Registration** – Ensures only customers within the defined range can access the feature.  
- **Feature Deactivation for Ineligible Customers** – Turns off the Delete Registration feature if the customer is not allowed to use it.

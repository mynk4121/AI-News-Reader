### **Half-Line Description:**

The `putOpenBankingApprovalFlag` method checks whether the Open Banking Approval feature is enabled, verifies throttling conditions, and disables the feature if any condition fails for a given cardholder.

---

### **Constants, Functions, Policies, and Sessions Used:**

- **Constants:**
  - `FeatureToFunction.OpenBankingApproval.getNewFeatureName()` → Represents the name of the Open Banking Approval feature.
  - `ConfigurationKeyConstants.OPEN_BANKING_ENABLED` → Configuration key for enabling or disabling Open Banking.
  - `ConfigurationKeyConstants.OPEN_BANKING_APPROVAL_THROTTLE_MIN` → Minimum throttle value for Open Banking Approval.
  - `ConfigurationKeyConstants.OPEN_BANKING_APPROVAL_THROTTLE_MAX` → Maximum throttle value for Open Banking Approval.

- **Functions:**
  - `serviceResponse.getAppFunctions()` → Retrieves a list of App Functions for the service response.
  - `isFeatureEnabled(ConfigurationKeyConstants.OPEN_BANKING_ENABLED, false)` → Checks if Open Banking is enabled in the environment configuration.
  - `featureSwitchService.isOpenBankingApprovalFeatureEnabled()` → Checks if the Open Banking Approval feature is enabled in the feature flags.
  - `throttlingService.isBCACardholderIdAllowedToContinueWithoutThrottling()` → Checks if the given cardholder ID is within throttling limits for Open Banking Approval.
  - `turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.OpenBankingApproval)` → Turns off the Open Banking Approval feature.

- **Policies:**
  - **Open Banking Approval Feature Availability** → Ensures that Open Banking is enabled in the environment and that the cardholder does not exceed throttling limits. If either condition is violated, the feature is turned off.

- **Session:**
  - **App Function Status**: Checks if Open Banking Approval is in the "ON" status and verifies the status of the associated feature flag and throttling condition.

---

### **Small Descriptions for Each Method:**

1. **`serviceResponse.getAppFunctions()`**
   - Retrieves all App Functions related to the service response to verify the status of the Open Banking Approval feature.

2. **`isFeatureEnabled(ConfigurationKeyConstants.OPEN_BANKING_ENABLED, false)`**
   - Checks if Open Banking is enabled for the system using the provided configuration key.

3. **`featureSwitchService.isOpenBankingApprovalFeatureEnabled()`**
   - Verifies whether the Open Banking Approval feature is enabled in the system configuration.

4. **`throttlingService.isBCACardholderIdAllowedToContinueWithoutThrottling()`**
   - Determines if the cardholder is allowed to proceed with Open Banking Approval without triggering throttling limits.

5. **`turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.OpenBankingApproval)`**
   - Disables the Open Banking Approval feature if conditions are not met (either feature disabled or throttling exceeded).

---

### **Method Flow Explanation:**

1. **Retrieve App Functions:**
   - The method starts by retrieving the list of `AppFunction` objects in the `serviceResponse`.

2. **Check Open Banking Approval Status:**
   - It iterates through the list of app functions and looks for the Open Banking Approval feature.
   - If the feature is found and its status is `ON`, it proceeds to check if Open Banking is enabled and evaluates throttling limits.

3. **Check Environment and Throttling:**
   - If Open Banking is enabled, it checks whether the Open Banking Approval feature is enabled in the configuration.
   - It also checks if the cardholder's activity falls within the allowed throttling range.

4. **Turn Off Feature if Conditions Fail:**
   - If the feature is not enabled, or if throttling conditions are exceeded, the method turns off the Open Banking Approval feature by calling `turnoffFunction()`.

5. **Exit Method:**
   - The loop exits after processing the Open Banking Approval feature.

---

This method ensures that the Open Banking Approval feature operates within set thresholds, ensuring that the cardholder does not exceed throttling limits and that the feature is only active when appropriate.

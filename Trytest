You're right! Here's the corrected identification of **custom code** in the method:

1. **Session Attributes for Membership**: 
   - Custom code that checks if the customer is a BAP member (`isBAPMembershipOnly()`) or a business-only member (`isBusinessOnlyMembership()`), and then sets these details in the session (`BIL_RESUME_BAP_MEMBER` and `BIL_RESUME_BUSINESS_MEMBER`).

2. **Turn Off Feature**:
   - Custom code that disables the "BIL Save & Resume" feature by calling `turnoffFunction()`, which is a specific action based on feature availability.

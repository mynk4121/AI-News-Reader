New Customer Verification - Process API
The New Customer Verification API for Barclays’ youth account onboarding involves a series of checks designed to validate the applicant’s age, identity, and background. The process interacts with Barclays’ internal systems and third-party services like Onfido to ensure all necessary customer data is validated before allowing account creation.

Verification Steps Overview
Age Check – Ensures the applicant is eligible based on age.
Onfido Document Verification – Validates identification documents through a third-party service.
Document & Customer Report Matching – Cross-verifies customer details with internal records using fuzzy logic.
Background Customer Locate Check – Identifies if the applicant exists in Barclays’ database and handles multiple matches.
1. Age Check
Purpose: Verify if the applicant falls within the youth account’s eligible age range (16 to 18 years).
Data Source: Prospect System API (to retrieve Date of Birth from Prospect Data Store).
Process:
Fetch customer’s Date of Birth.
Calculate the applicant’s current age based on the system date.
Eligibility Check:
If the applicant is younger than 16 or older than 18, they are informed of ineligibility and the process is terminated.
Required Data:

Date of Birth (DOB).
2. Onfido Document Verification
Purpose: Verify the applicant's identity using official documents through the Onfido API.
Data Sources: Onfido API for ID verification, Customer System API for retrieving customer data.
Key Steps:

Document Type Check:
Confirms if the provided document (e.g., Passport, National ID) is a supported type.
Blacklist Check:
Validates the document against a blacklist to prevent fraud.
Selfie Verification:
Matches the customer’s live selfie with the ID document photo.
Outcomes:

Document Approved: If the document and selfie match, the customer proceeds.
Mismatch or Blacklisted Document: If there’s a selfie mismatch or the document is blacklisted, the process is flagged for manual review.
Required Data:

Document Type.
Selfie Photo.
Customer-entered data (First Name, Last Name, etc.).
3. Document & Customer Report Matching
Purpose: Cross-checks the customer’s entered details (e.g., Name, DOB) with Barclays’ internal records.
Data Sources: Prospect System API for the applicant’s information and document data.
Process:

The system uses fuzzy logic to handle variations in the customer’s input and internal records.
Key Data Points Compared:
First Name (FN), Middle Name (MN), Last Name (LN), Date of Birth (DOB), Address.
Any mismatches or missing information trigger specific fuzzy rules to attempt to resolve discrepancies before rejecting the match.
Fuzzy Matching Rules:
FL001 - Data Cleanup:

Removes spaces and special characters in the customer’s name before comparing it to the internal records.
A Regular Expression (REGEX) function is applied for uniformity.
FL002a - Handling Null Fields:

If a name field (e.g., Last Name) is NULL, the system copies the available name into the empty field.
This rule helps resolve cases where the applicant provides only one name.
FL002b - Multi-Word Names:

Splits multi-word names into their respective fields:
The first word is assigned as First Name.
The remaining words are treated as the Last Name.
FL003 - Character Threshold Check:

Allows for up to a 10% character difference between the customer-provided name and the document name.
Minor spelling mistakes (e.g., "Jonh" vs. "John") are tolerated within this threshold.
FL004 - Exact Match for Non-Null Fields:

When all fields (First Name, Last Name) are non-null, an exact match is expected.
FL005 - Word Juggling Match:

Separates names into individual words and compares each separately.
This rule keeps spaces between names and uses split matching techniques to account for name order differences.
Required Data:

First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Address.
4. Background Customer Locate Check
Purpose: Search Barclays' internal records to check if the customer already exists.
Data Source: Customer System API, which accesses the Customer Data Store.
Key Steps:

The customer’s provided information (First Name, Last Name, Gender, Postcode, Date of Birth) is compared against the internal database.
Outcomes:

No Match: If no matching record is found, the applicant is offered a Letter Drop Journey, where a verification letter is sent to their address for confirmation.
Single Match: If a single match is found, the customer proceeds to the next steps.
Multiple Matches: If multiple records are found (due to similar names, DOBs, or addresses), the application is flagged for branch verification.
Required Data:

First Name, Last Name, Gender, Postcode, Date of Birth.
Additional Key Considerations
All checks must be completed in sequence. Each validation step depends on the success of the previous one.
External APIs like Onfido are crucial for document and identity validation.
Barclays’ internal APIs (e.g., Prospect System API, Customer System API) facilitate the retrieval and comparison of customer data.
Discrepancies in customer information (such as age or name mismatch) will lead to manual review or termination of the process.
Summary of Fuzzy Matching Rules
FL001 - Data Cleanup: Ensures data consistency by removing special characters.
FL002a - Handling Null Fields: Resolves missing name fields by copying available data.
FL002b - Multi-Word Names: Manages names with multiple words and assigns them to the correct fields.
FL003 - Character Threshold Check: Allows a 10% character variation to tolerate minor errors.
FL004 - Exact Match: Requires exact matching when both fields are filled.
FL005 - Word Juggling: Matches names by breaking them into individual words and comparing them separately.

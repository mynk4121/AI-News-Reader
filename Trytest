Manage Applications Capability Description
The Manage Applications capability focuses on handling the lifecycle of a customer's application, including creation, updates, and retrieval of application details. This ensures a streamlined and efficient process for managing customer data while maintaining transparency and user control. Below is the detailed breakdown based on the provided design:

1. Retrieving the Current Account Product Page
Route: /GET getProductHoldings
Purpose:
This service checks if the customer can access the product page for the selected current account.
It ensures that the relevant product information is fetched accurately and displayed to the user.
2. Barclays App Gateway
Role:
Acts as a middleware layer that facilitates secure communication between the Barclays App Front-End Platform (BAFP) and internal Barclays services.
Ensures requests are routed and processed efficiently.
3. Barclays Experience API
Role:
A centralized API responsible for managing the lifecycle of application records.
It handles three core actions:
Create Applicant: Generates a new application record for a specific customer ID.
Update Application: Manages updates to application status, including KYC markers, step tracker updates, and cancellation handling.
Get Applicant Details: Retrieves existing application data from the Prospect Data Store, ensuring consistency and quick access.
4. TCV API
Role:
A REST-based source system API that interacts with the back-end to fetch and update data related to the applicant.
It ensures that all application-related information is synchronized across systems.
5. Applicant Data Store
Role:
A database that stores all information related to the applicant's application.
Acts as the central repository for application records, enabling seamless retrieval and updates during the application lifecycle.
Key Features of the Capability
Application Creation

When a customer initiates the application process, an application record is created using the Application Management Create Applicant route (/POST application).
The customer ID and journey type are stored in the data store for traceability.
Application Update

Updates are managed through the Application Management Update Application route (/PATCH application).
This includes:
Modifying KYC markers after identity verification.
Tracking the progress in the step tracker.
Handling cancellations or resumption of the application.
Application Retrieval

Customers can view their application details via the Application Management Get Applicant Details route (/GET personal details).
This ensures the user can access their application data anytime.
Benefits of the Design
Efficiency: By integrating APIs and a centralized data store, data retrieval and updates are processed in real-time.
Scalability: The modular design enables the addition of new functionalities with minimal disruption.
User Transparency: Real-time updates to step trackers and easy access to application details enhance the user experience.
Data Consistency: The synchronized flow between APIs and databases ensures data integrity across the system.

### **Method Description: `putStrategicAggregationPaymentFeature`**  

#### **Feature Environment is ON:**  
- The method verifies whether **Strategic Aggregation Payments (SAPayments)** is enabled via:  
  ```java
  configValues.isFeatureEnabled(ConfigurationKeyConstants.STRATEGIC_AGGREGATION_PAYMENTS_ENABLED, false)
  ```  
- It also checks if the **Strategic Aggregation Payments feature** is available for the request:  
  ```java
  isFeatureAvailable(FeatureToFunction.StrategicAggregationPayments, serviceRequest)
  ```  

#### **RATIO (Feature is Enabled if All Conditions are Met):**  
- **Feature switch is ON in configuration** → Checked using:  
  ```java
  configValues.isFeatureEnabled(ConfigurationKeyConstants.STRATEGIC_AGGREGATION_PAYMENTS_ENABLED, false)
  ```  
- **Customer is NOT within the registration delay period** → Ensures the customer has been registered long enough:  
  ```java
  this.strategicAggregationCustomerChecksService.isInStrategicAggregationPaymentsRegistrationDelayPeriod(mobileUserContext)
  ```  
- **Customer is eligible for the feature** → Validates if the customer meets the criteria using session attributes:  
  ```java
  this.strategicAggregationCustomerChecksService.isStrategicAggregationPaymentsFeatureEnabled(
      serviceRequest, customerContext, isFeatureAvailable,
      (List<CustomerGroupType>) sessionParameters.get(OperationConstants.CUSTOMER_GROUP_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE)
  )
  ```  

#### **Feature is Turned OFF if Any Condition Fails:**  
- If **any** of the conditions fail, the feature is explicitly turned OFF using:  
  ```java
  turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.StrategicAggregationPayments);
  ```  
- A log entry is recorded to indicate that **Strategic Aggregation Payments** is disabled.

## **Constants, Functions, Policies, and Sessions Used**  

### **Constants (From the Method):**  
1. **`ConfigurationKeyConstants.STRATEGIC_AGGREGATION_PAYMENTS_ENABLED`** → Determines if Strategic Aggregation Payments are enabled.  
2. **`FeatureToFunction.StrategicAggregationPayments`** → Represents the Strategic Aggregation Payments feature switch.  
3. **`OperationConstants.CUSTOMER_GROUP_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE`** → Stores customer group session data for validation.  

### **Functions and Their Explanation (From the Method):**  
1. **`isFeatureAvailable(FeatureToFunction.StrategicAggregationPayments, serviceRequest)`** → Checks if the SAPayments feature is available for the request.  
2. **`configValues.isFeatureEnabled(ConfigurationKeyConstants.STRATEGIC_AGGREGATION_PAYMENTS_ENABLED, false)`** → Determines if SAPayments is enabled at the configuration level.  
3. **`strategicAggregationCustomerChecksService.isInStrategicAggregationPaymentsRegistrationDelayPeriod(mobileUserContext)`** → Checks if the customer is within the registration delay period, which would disable the feature.  
4. **`strategicAggregationCustomerChecksService.isStrategicAggregationPaymentsFeatureEnabled(...)`** → Verifies if the customer meets the required criteria to enable the feature.  
5. **`turnoffFunction(serviceResponse, FeatureToFunction.StrategicAggregationPayments)`** → Deactivates the feature if any of the conditions fail.  

### **Policy Checks (From the Method):**  
- **Registration Delay Policy:** Ensures that customers who registered recently do not get the feature immediately.  
- **Feature Activation Policy:** Ensures SAPayments is enabled only for customers who meet the eligibility criteria.  

### **Session Parameters:**  
- **`OperationConstants.CUSTOMER_GROUP_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE`** → Stores customer group details used to validate SAPayments eligibility.

## **Custom Code Check:**  
Yes, **this method contains custom code.**  

### **Custom Code Behavior:**  
- **Customer-based eligibility check using session parameters** → The method retrieves customer group information from the session before enabling the feature.  
- **Registration delay logic** → This custom logic prevents customers from accessing the feature if they were recently registered, ensuring a controlled rollout.  
- **Explicit feature deactivation** → Unlike a normal feature toggle, this method **actively disables the feature** for ineligible customers.  

This **custom logic ensures that only eligible customers who pass all validation checks can use Strategic Aggregation Payments**.

### **Half-Line Description:**  
The `execute` method updates a customer's address after validating feature availability, channel checks, and user session, while handling errors and setting appropriate response statuses.

---

### **Constants, Functions, Policies, and Sessions Used:**

- **Constants:**
  - `OperationConstants.ADDRESS_LOOKUP_UPDATE` → Defines the operation function for address lookup and update.
  - `ErrorCodes.MSG_OP_FAILED` → Error code for operation failure.
  - `ErrorCodes.SECURITY_SESSION_VALIDATION_FAILED` → Error code for security validation failure.
  - `ErrorCodes.MSG_OP_FATAL` → Error code for fatal operation failure.
  
- **Functions:**
  - `FeatureFlagsServiceResponse.isFeatureAvailable()` → Checks if the address lookup and update feature is available for the current function.
  - `getMobileUserContext()` → Retrieves the mobile user context for session validation.
  - `serviceRequest.getChannelId()` → Retrieves the channel ID (BMB or others) for the request.
  - `serviceRequest.getParameter(APP_FUNCTION)` → Retrieves the application function parameter to validate the app function.
  - `businessService.updateAddresswithoutCapscan()` → Updates the address in the system without using the Capscan service.
  - `setSuccessStatusCodes()` → Sets the success status codes for a successful response.
  - `setFailureStatusCodes()` → Sets failure status codes for the operation if any error occurs.

- **Policies:**
  - **Feature Availability Policy** → Verifies whether the address lookup and update feature is enabled and available for the requested function.
  - **Channel and Function Validation Policy** → Ensures that the request matches the expected channel (BMB) and function (Address Lookup and Update).
  - **Session Validation Policy** → Checks if the mobile user context exists in the session, preventing further actions if the session is invalid.
  - **Fraud Detection Policy** → Determines if the request is suspicious (e.g., invalid feature flag status) and stops further processing in case of fraud.
  
- **Session:**
  - `getMobileUserContext()` → Retrieves the mobile user context from the session for session validation and authentication.

### **Small Descriptions for Each Method:**

1. **`getMobileUserContext()`**
   - Retrieves the mobile user context from the session to ensure that the request is authenticated and valid.

2. **`serviceRequest.getChannelId()`**
   - Retrieves the channel ID from the request to verify whether the request originates from the BMB channel.

3. **`serviceRequest.getParameter(APP_FUNCTION)`**
   - Extracts the application function from the request to check if it matches the expected value for address lookup and update.

4. **`FeatureFlagsServiceResponse.isFeatureAvailable()`**
   - Checks whether the address lookup and update feature is enabled for the requested function.

5. **`businessService.updateAddresswithoutCapscan()`**
   - Updates the customer’s address in the database without using the Capscan service for address verification.

6. **`setSuccessStatusCodes()`**
   - Sets the success status codes in the response upon a successful address update.

7. **`setFailureStatusCodes()`**
   - Sets failure status codes in the response if an error occurs during the update process or session validation.

8. **`LOGGER.debug()` / `LOGGER.error()` / `LOGGER.trace()`**
   - Logs debug, error, and trace messages to monitor and trace the flow of the method, helping in error tracking and debugging.

### **Policy-Specific Breakdown:**

- **Feature Availability Policy**  
  - Ensures the requested operation (address lookup and update) is enabled before proceeding.

- **Channel and Function Validation Policy**  
  - Confirms that the request originates from the BMB channel and that the app function corresponds to the expected update request.

- **Session Validation Policy**  
  - Ensures the mobile user context is available in the session. If missing, it stops further processing and returns an error.

- **Fraud Detection Policy**  
  - Handles scenarios where the app function or feature flag is set to `OFF`, marking the request as suspicious and halting further execution.

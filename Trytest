  - `OperationConstants.OVERDRAFT_CMA_SESSION` → Stores the status of the Overdraft AMC session.
  
- **Functions:**
  - `configvalues.getBooleanProperty()` → Retrieves configuration values to check if dynamic product functionality is enabled.
  - `featureFlagsService.isFeatureAvailable()` → Checks if the Overdraft AMC feature is available based on the current request and device context.
  - `isFeatureAvailable()` → Verifies if the Overdraft AMC feature is enabled based on the feature switch and returns the status.
  - `turnoffFunction()` → Turns off the Overdraft AMC feature in the service response if the feature is unavailable.
  - `sessionParameters.put()` → Stores the Overdraft AMC status in the session for subsequent use.

- **Policies:**
  - **Dynamic Feature Switching Policy** → If dynamic switching is enabled, it uses the `featureFlagsService` to check the feature availability based on the device context and product class codes.

   - Retrieves configuration values to determine if dynamic product functionality switching is enabled or not.

2. **`featureFlagsService.isFeatureAvailable()`**
   - Checks the availability of the Overdraft AMC feature using the feature flags service based on device context and product class codes.

3. **`isFeatureAvailable()`**
   - Verifies the status of the Overdraft AMC feature in the function table and checks if the feature is available or not.

4. **`turnoffFunction()`**
   - Disables the Overdraft AMC feature in the service response if the feature is unavailable or disabled.

5. **`sessionParameters.put()`**
   - Stores the Overdraft AMC feature's status (ON/OFF) in the session for use in future operations, ensuring consistent session handling.

### **Policy-Specific Breakdown:**

- **Dynamic Feature Switching Policy**  
  - The method first checks if dynamic product functionality switching is enabled. If true, it checks the availability of the Overdraft AMC feature with additional parameters such as device context and product class codes. If false, it performs the same check with simpler parameters.

- **Feature Availability Policy**  
  - If the feature is available, the method updates the session with the feature status. If unavailable, it turns off the feature and updates the session to indicate that the feature is off.

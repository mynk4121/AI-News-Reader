**Introduction to Hypervisor**

- **What is a Hypervisor?**
  - A **hypervisor** is a **software layer** that enables virtualization by allowing multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical computer.

- **How it Works**:
  - The hypervisor **allocates resources** (like CPU, memory, and storage) to each virtual machine.
  - It ensures that each VM is **isolated** and operates independently.

- **Types of Hypervisors**:
  - **Type 1 (Bare-Metal)**: Runs directly on physical hardware.
    - **Example**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V.
  - **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Runs on top of an existing operating system.
    - **Example**: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Multiple VMs on a single physical machine.
  - **Isolation**: VMs are isolated, preventing one from affecting the others.
  - **Flexibility**: Run different operating systems on the same hardware.

- **Usage**:
  - Used in **data centers**, **cloud computing**, and for **testing** or **development** environments.

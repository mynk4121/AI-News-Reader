Here are the key characteristics of cloud computing, explained simply with examples:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   - **Explanation**: Cloud services can be accessed as needed without human intervention.
   - **Example**: If you need more storage on Google Drive, you can simply upgrade your plan with a few clicks.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   - **Explanation**: Cloud services are available over the internet and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
   - **Example**: You can access your files on Dropbox from your laptop, phone, or tablet.

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   - **Explanation**: Cloud providers pool resources (like servers, storage) to serve multiple customers. Resources are shared dynamically based on demand.
   - **Example**: Multiple businesses share the same server infrastructure but use only the resources they need at a given time, like how Netflix streams content to millions using a shared infrastructure.

4. **Rapid Elasticity**  
   - **Explanation**: Cloud resources can be quickly scaled up or down depending on demand.
   - **Example**: An online shopping website can scale up its servers during peak shopping times (like Black Friday) and scale down afterward.

5. **Measured Service**  
   - **Explanation**: Cloud computing is often billed based on usage, meaning you pay for what you use.
   - **Example**: AWS charges based on how much data you store or how many compute hours you use.

6. **Multi-Tenancy**  
   - **Explanation**: Multiple customers share the same physical resources, but their data and applications are isolated from each other.
   - **Example**: Google Cloud hosts data for multiple customers on the same servers, but each user can only access their own data.

These characteristics make cloud computing flexible, cost-efficient, and accessible from anywhere.
